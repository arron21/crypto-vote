# stellar contract deploy files
contains WASM files built from soroban-crypto-vote.

each 'election' and 'ballot' instance requires one of these files is deployed to the stellar blockchain.
once we've deployed a contract and created a ledger (aka a 'block' on the chain), we can invoke functions as required.
