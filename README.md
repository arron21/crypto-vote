# crypto-vote

run 'node npm run start' to start the express server http://localhost:3000/



what can i add?
generate results in ui
add favicon :mail:
get vote by id (entrybox for id)
rename app to server.js?

nah i'm introducing dependencies. i can go ahead and make an example with POJS and EJS but it's probably not so nice in the end.
